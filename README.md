# AwesomeDashboard

This is a webextension for Chrome that acts as a Dashboard containing:
- SoundCloud search/play widget
    github repo: https://github.com/njoel24/angular4-soundcloud    
    desc: I forked a project in angular2, I transalted it in angular4, added IndexedDB support (not ready yet) and a general refactor
- Youtube search/play widget
    github repo: https://github.com/njoel24/one-source-of-truth-for-angular
    desc: I forked an already existed project, I added the play video feature and I used fusebox as a module bundle
- Maps lookFor/directions widget
    github repo: https://github.com/njoel24/google-maps-api-js
- News api widget
    github repo: https://github.com/njoel24/news-reader
    desc: I used angular4 and I used the factory pattern to handle the providers
